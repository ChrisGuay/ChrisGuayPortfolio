# Work Experience

### RSM: Finance Automation Consulting Intern 
At RSM, I completed a summer internship program on the Finance Automation team. I helped my colleagues complete projects to help clients optimize their treasury management, account reconciliations, and month-end accounting closing processes. I used a software named BlackLine to help with the accounting processes, and another software named Kyriba for treasury management. I was also exposed to the Workiva and Coupa softwares which I hope to use in the future. Using Excel, I performed simple data analysis to match up transactions and accounts. I mainly used pivot tables and lookups for this. Finally, I spent lots of time creating PowerPoints and templates for team and client use. 

### Bright Stores: Market Analysis Intern
At Bright Stores, I completed a summer long market analysis project using Salesforce. Specifically, I used Salesforce to store data and create reports. The basic premise of the project was to research and analyze competitors and potential target clients. I used a variety of methods for research including the internet, email inquiries, and phone calls. Also, I was trained in the Bright Stores' in-house website software. With this, I made basic client mock promotional sites. 

### Treeline Construction: Construction Laborer
With Treeline, I have helped with numerous construction projects. I would complete tasks such as painting, set-up, clean-up, and many other tasks. Through my work, I learned valuable skills in project and site management. I also learned how to better communicate with co-workers and work as a team player. 

### Sells Law Firm: Assistant Paralegal 
At Sells Law Firm, I created many templates using Word while being exposed to estate planning and real-estate law. I would complete client documents and scan them into our system. I would also organize the client documents into binders for the clients and a filing system for the business. I completed various other tasks as well such as writing letters to courts and reaching out to clients. This taught me excellent communication and organization skills. Another big part of my job was greeting clients and taking care of any needs they had. This taught me strong customer service skills.
