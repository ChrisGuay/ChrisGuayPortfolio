This is a heat map I made using a GAM model in R. I scraped the Colorado Avalanche live data from the NHL API to create the GAM model which predicts the likelihood of scoring a goal based on where a player is on the ice. Based on the GAM, I was able to create the heat map.

This is a dashboard I created using Power BI. THe dashboard presents my findings for the question listed at the top using a fictional database I created for a ski manufacturer. Through ETL, I turned the original database into a datamart in SSMS. For the ETL, I used Visual Studio. From there, I simply imported the data mart into Power BI and created the dashboard. I used several charts, cards, and a slicer to provide all the necessary information. Finally, I completed an analysis and made recommendations for the company.

This is a a classification tree I created using JMP. I had used car data from the UK to answer the question of what variables factor into how much the car sells for. I created several regressions and other classifications, but this classification tree truly shows the important variables that factored into the price.
